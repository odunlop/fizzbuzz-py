 # FizzBuzz in Python
 Created as part of my exercises for learning a new language - Python 3

 ## Requirements
 
 Write a program that:
 * Calculates the "FizzBuzz sequence" from 1 to 20.
   * For each integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
     * If the number is divisible by 3, replace the number with `Fizz`.
     * If the number is divisible by 5, replace the number with `Buzz`
     * If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the number with
       `FizzBuzz`.
     * If the number is divisible by neither 3 or 5, keep the number.
 * Is fully tested using unittest
